Welcome to the Warhammer Collection,

this is the sixth update (June 2022) we're doing on the WH lore and thanks to the feedback received we managed to archive:

- an improved sorting
- added new released books
- replaced/deleted many non-retail


ALL the books have been renamed with Author's Name Surname - Book title (Series) for an easy search.


The retail tag means how the book was ripped 

[Retail] - Books that i have bought myself and i have removed the DRM thru calibre
(Retail) - Books shared by other users whom DRM has been remove correcly thru calibre
(retail) - Books shared by other users who purchased the books but not drm'ed correctly with calibre

With this im hoping to give the reader a complete collection of WH books in their best available format and somehow well sorted.

If you enjoyed this and found some issues such as typos, bad scans/conversions, misplaced books and pretty much anything please send me a message. 


Lastly a huge thanks goes to all the people that helped out with this project. Thank you!
